# Powershell Themes 
Two cool Oh My Posh Themes for Powershell.

## Inspiration üí≠
I like the terminal that [@HolaMundo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4FHiPgS1KXkUMx3dxBUtPg) uses in his videos (simple and fast), so I wanted to make it's copy but in PowerShell and this is the result.

## How to Install ‚ùî
### First
You can install a new terminal only if you want, it is not totally necessary, but it is cooler and provides more functionality than the default 
<br>
[Windows Terminal Preview](https://www.microsoft.com/es-ar/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n8g5rfz9xk3?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab).

### Second
Install a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) and set it in the terminal. (In this case is useless, but it will be able to help you to see icons in the terminal if you wish)

### Fast way
You can clone this repo and just run install.ps1, this it's gonna install all you need and put the themes in your WindowsPowerShell folder inside other folder named "Themes".
